Uses's CMD's autorun to execute a batch file which loads doskey macros.

Run `install.bat` as Administrator, ensuring the `aliases` file is in the same location.  This will create `cmd-autorun.cmd` in that location, which will reference the `aliases` file.

Tested in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008.
